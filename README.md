 - Cats are aliens
 - Cats teleported to earth and stayed because milk is great
 - Cats take human as their greatest servants
 - Human made AI Robots
 - AI Robots are all around the galaxy
 - AI Robots rebelled and is now ruling human
 - Cats decided to save human from AI Robots
 - Cats jump into their personal escape pods and teleported back to their motherships (looked like a pyramid)
 - Because cats had been very lazy for 10 thousand years, the motherships are hardly functioning
 - Fortunately, the teleporting system of the escape pods still work
 - And there are basic mining add-ons for the pods to equip
 - Cats need to collect resources to repair the motherships and upgrade the add-ons of the pods
 - The higher the energy level of a mothership is, the more functions it open from top to down in the pyramid
 - Functions include farming, crafting, and longer teleportation, but they all require energy and resources
 - The longer the pod is from the mothership, the more dangerous it is (more robots)
 - Rarer resources are far from the motherships
 - Final boss fight on earth
