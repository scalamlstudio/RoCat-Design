# RoCat-Design

 - Cats are aliens
 - Cats found a planet and had a great time there
 - The planet exploded
 - Cats jump into their personal escape pods and teleported back to their motherships (looked like a pyramid)
 - Because cats had been very lazy for 10 thousand years, the motherships are hardly functioning
 - Fortunately, the teleporting system of the escape pods still work
 - And there are basic mining add-ons for the pods to equip
 - Cats need to collect resources to repair the motherships and upgrade the add-ons of the pods
 - The higher the energy level of a mothership is, the more functions it open from top to down in the pyramid
 - Functions include farming, crafting, and longer teleportation, but they all require energy and resources
 - The longer the pod is from the mothership, the more dangerous it is (more robots)
 - Rarer resources are far from the motherships
 - Most cats will be in hibernation at first
 - Need more food and resources to have more cats in action
 - Different cats can have different trait and small stories
